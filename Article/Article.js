/* Step 1: Create a function that creates a component. You will want your component to look like the template below: 
  
  <div class="article">
    <h2>{title of the article}</h2>
    <p class="date">{date of the article}</p>

    {three separate paragraph elements}

    <span class='expandButton'></span>
  </div>
  
  Hint: You will need to use createElement more than once here!

  Your function should take either an object as it's one argument, or 5 separate arguments mapping to each piece of the data object above.

  Step 2: Add an event listener to the expandButton span. This event listener should toggle the class 'article-open' on the 'article' div.

  Step 3: return the entire component.

  Step 4: Map over the data, creating a component for each oject and add each component to the DOM as children of the 'articles' div.

  Step 5: Add a new article to the array. Make sure it is in the same format as the others. Refresh the page to see the new article.
